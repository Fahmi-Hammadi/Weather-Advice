| Function Name | Input Parameters | Output Parameters | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| userExists | String username | boolean | Checks if a user exists in the database |\n| readFile | String filename | String | Reads the contents of a file |\n| doStuff | int a, int b | int | Performs unclear operation on two integers |\n| printUpperCase | String s |  | Prints the uppercase version of a string |\n| encryptPassword | String password | String | Supposed to encrypt a password, but does not |\n\n| Code | Explanation | Proposed Modification |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `private static String DB_PASS = "password";` | Hardcoded password is a security issue | Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive data |\n| `String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";` | SQL Injection vulnerability | Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection |\n| `// reader.close(); // Bug: resource not closed` | Resource not closed, potential memory leak | Close resources in a finally block or use try-with-resources statement |\n| `catch(IOException e) { // Silently ignore errors }` | Silently ignoring errors, potential issues | Log or handle exceptions properly to ensure error visibility and debugging |\n| `if(a > 100) return b / (a - 100); // possible divide by zero` | Possible divide by zero error | Add a check for division by zero and handle it accordingly |\n| `System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());` | Null dereference risk | Check for null before calling methods on an object |\n| `// TODO: Implement encryption (never done)` | TODO comment, encryption not implemented | Implement encryption as per the requirements and remove the TODO comment |\n\n| Function Name | Maintainability Issue |\n| --- | --- |\n| userExists | Inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, violation of SOLID principles |\n| readFile | Poor code structure and organization, low readability, code duplication |\n| doStuff | Poor code structure and organization, low readability, unclear purpose |\n| printUpperCase | Null dereference risk, low readability |\n| encryptPassword | Violation of SOLID principles, low readability, unclear purpose |
