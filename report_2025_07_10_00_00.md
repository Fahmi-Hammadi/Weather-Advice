| Function Name | Input Parameters with Types | Output Parameters with Types | Purpose of the Function |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| userExists | String username | boolean | Checks if a user exists in the database |\n| readFile | String filename | String | Reads the contents of a file |\n| doStuff | int a, int b | int | Performs unclear operation on two integers |\n| printUpperCase | String s | None | Prints a string in uppercase |\n| encryptPassword | String password | String | Encrypts a password (not actually implemented) |\n| Code | Explanation | Proposed Modification |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `private static String DB_PASS = \"password\";` | Hardcoded password is a security issue | Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive credentials |\n| `String sql = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = \\'\\" + username + \\\"\\'\\";` | SQL Injection vulnerability | Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection |\n| `BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename));` | Resource not closed in case of exception | Use try-with-resources statement to ensure resources are closed properly |\n| `catch(IOException e) { // Silently ignore errors }` | Silently ignoring errors can lead to unexpected behavior | Log or handle exceptions properly to ensure errors are not ignored |\n| `public static int doStuff(int a, int b) { if(a > 100) return b / (a - 100); // possible divide by zero }` | Possible divide by zero error | Add a check to prevent division by zero |\n| `public static void printUpperCase(String s) { System.out.println(s.toUpperCase()); }` | Null dereference risk | Add a null check before calling `toUpperCase()` |\n| `public static String encryptPassword(String password) { // Not actually encrypting! return password; }` | Password not actually encrypted | Implement proper encryption using a secure encryption algorithm |\n| Function Name | Maintainability Issues |\n| --- | --- |\n| userExists | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Violation of SOLID principles |\n| readFile | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Violation of SOLID principles, Code Duplication |\n| doStuff | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Violation of SOLID principles |\n| printUpperCase | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Violation of SOLID principles |\n| encryptPassword | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Violation of SOLID principles |
