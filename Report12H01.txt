Function Identification: | Function Name | Input Parameters with Types | Output Parameters with Types | Purpose | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | userExists | username (String) | boolean | Checks if a user exists in the database | | readFile | filename (String) | String | Reads the contents of a file | | doStuff | a (int), b (int) | int | Performs an unclear operation on two integers | | printUpperCase | s (String) |  | Prints a string in uppercase | | encryptPassword | password (String) | String | Claims to encrypt a password but does not actually do so | # Risk Identification: | Code | Explanation | Proposed Modification | | --- | --- | --- | | `private static String DB_PASS = "password";` | Hardcoded password is a security issue | Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive information | | `String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";` | SQL Injection vulnerability | Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection | | `// reader.close(); // Bug: resource not closed` | Resource not closed, potential memory leak | Close resources in a finally block or use try-with-resources statement | | `catch(IOException e) { // Silently ignore errors }` | Silently ignoring errors, potential issues | Log or handle exceptions properly to ensure error visibility and debugging | | `if(a > 100) return b / (a - 100); // possible divide by zero` | Possible divide by zero error | Add a check for division by zero and handle it accordingly | | `System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());` | Null dereference risk | Check for null before calling methods on an object | | `// TODO: Implement encryption (never done)` | TODO comment, encryption not implemented | Implement encryption as per the requirements and remove the TODO comment | # Maintainability Issues: | Function Name | Maintainability Issues | | --- | --- | | userExists | poor code structure and organization, violation of SOLID principles | | readFile | poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, violation of SOLID principles | | doStuff | poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, violation of SOLID principles | | printUpperCase | poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, violation of SOLID principles | | encryptPassword | poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, violation of SOLID principles |
