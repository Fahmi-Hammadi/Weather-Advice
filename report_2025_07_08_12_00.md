| Function Name | Input Parameters | Output Parameters | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| userExists | username (String) | boolean | Checks if a user exists in the database |
| readFile | filename (String) | String | Reads the contents of a file |
| doStuff | a (int), b (int) | int | Performs unclear operation on two integers |
| printUpperCase | s (String) | None | Prints the uppercase version of a string |
| encryptPassword | password (String) | String | Supposed to encrypt a password, but does not |

| Code | Explanation | Proposed Modification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `private static String DB_PASS = "password";` | Hardcoded password is a security issue | Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive credentials |
| `String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '\" + username + "'";` | SQL Injection vulnerability | Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection |
| `// reader.close(); // Bug: resource not closed` | Resource not closed, potential memory leak | Close resources in a finally block or use try-with-resources statement |
| `catch(IOException e) { // Silently ignore errors }` | Silently ignoring errors, potential issues | Log or handle exceptions properly to ensure error visibility and debugging |
| `if(a > 100) return b / (a - 100); // possible divide by zero` | Possible divide by zero error | Add a check for division by zero and handle it accordingly |
| `System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());` | Null dereference risk | Check for null before calling methods on an object |
| `// TODO: Implement encryption (never done)` | Encryption not implemented, security issue | Implement proper encryption for sensitive data |

| Function Name | Maintainability Issues |
| --- | --- |
| userExists | Poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, violation of SOLID principles |
| readFile | Poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, violation of SOLID principles, code duplication |
| doStuff | Poorly named method, unclear purpose, low readability |
| printUpperCase | Null dereference risk, low readability |
| encryptPassword | TODO: Implement encryption (never done), low readability |
