| Function Name | Input Parameters with Types | Output Parameters with Types | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| userExists | username (String) | boolean | Returns true if user exists, false otherwise |
| readFile | filename (String) | String | Reads a file and returns its contents |
| doStuff | a (int), b (int) | int | Unclear purpose, poorly named method |
| printUpperCase | s (String) |  | Prints the input string in uppercase |
| encryptPassword | password (String) | String | Not actually encrypting, TODO: Implement encryption |

| Code | Explanation | Proposed Modification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `private static String DB_PASS = "password";` | Hardcoded password is a security issue | Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive credentials |
| `String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";` | SQL Injection vulnerability | Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection |
| `// reader.close(); // Bug: resource not closed` | Resource not closed, potential memory leak | Close resources in a finally block or use try-with-resources statement |
| `catch(IOException e) { // Silently ignore errors }` | Silently ignoring errors, potential issues | Log or handle exceptions properly to ensure error visibility and debugging |
| `if(a > 100) return b / (a - 100); // possible divide by zero` | Possible divide by zero error | Add a check for division by zero and handle it accordingly |
| `System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());` | Null dereference risk | Check for null before calling methods on an object |
| `// TODO: Implement encryption (never done)` | Not actually encrypting, TODO: Implement encryption | Implement proper encryption using a secure encryption algorithm and library |
