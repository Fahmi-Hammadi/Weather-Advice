# Function Analysis
| Function Name | Input Parameters | Output Parameters | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| userExists | String username | boolean | Returns true if user exists, false otherwise |
| readFile | String filename | String | Reads a file and returns its contents |
| doStuff | int a, int b | int | Unclear purpose, possible divide by zero |
| printUpperCase | String s | void | Prints the input string in uppercase |
| encryptPassword | String password | String | Not actually encrypting, returns the original password |

# Risk Analysis
| Code | Explanation | Proposed Modification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `private static String DB_PASS = "password";` | Hardcoded password is a security issue | Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive credentials |
| `String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";` | SQL Injection vulnerability | Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection |
| `// reader.close(); // Bug: resource not closed` | Resource not closed, potential memory leak | Close resources in a finally block or use try-with-resources statement |
| `catch(IOException e) { // Silently ignore errors }` | Silently ignoring errors, potential issues | Log or handle exceptions properly to ensure error visibility and debugging |
| `if(a > 100) return b / (a - 100); // possible divide by zero` | Possible divide by zero error | Add a check for division by zero and handle it accordingly |
| `System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());` | Null dereference risk | Check for null before calling methods on an object |
| `// TODO: Implement encryption (never done)` | Not actually encrypting, returns the original password | Implement proper encryption using a secure encryption algorithm and library |

# Maintainability Analysis
| Function Name | Maintainability Issues |
| --- | --- |
| userExists | Poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, violation of SOLID principles |
| readFile | Poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, code duplication |
| doStuff | Poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, unclear purpose |
| printUpperCase | Poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, null dereference risk |
| encryptPassword | Poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions, low readability, TODO comment indicating incomplete implementation |
