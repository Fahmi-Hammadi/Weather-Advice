| Code | Risk | Proposed Modification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `private static String DB_PASS = "password";` | Hardcoded password | Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive credentials. |
| `String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";` | SQL Injection vulnerability | Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. |
| `BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename));` | Resource leak | Close the `BufferedReader` in a `finally` block or use a try-with-resources statement to ensure it is closed. |
| `catch(IOException e) { // Silently ignore errors }` | Poor error handling | Log or handle exceptions properly to avoid silent failures and improve debuggability. |
| `public static int doStuff(int a, int b) { if(a > 100) return b / (a - 100); // possible divide by zero }` | Divide by zero risk | Add a check for `a - 100 == 0` before performing the division. |
| `public static void printUpperCase(String s) { System.out.println(s.toUpperCase()); }` | Null dereference risk | Add a null check for `s` before calling `toUpperCase()`. |
| `public static String encryptPassword(String password) { // Not actually encrypting! return password; }` | Insecure password storage | Implement proper password encryption using a secure algorithm like bcrypt or PBKDF2. |
