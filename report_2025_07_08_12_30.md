Observation: | Function Name | Input Parameters | Output Parameters | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| userExists | String username | boolean | Returns true if user exists, false otherwise |
| readFile | String filename | String | Reads a file and returns its contents |
| doStuff | int a, int b | int | Unclear purpose, possibly performs some arithmetic operation |
| printUpperCase | String s |  | Prints the input string in uppercase |
| encryptPassword | String password | String | Not actually encrypting, just returns the input password |

| Code | Explanation | Proposed Modification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `private static String DB_PASS = "password";` | Hardcoded password is a security issue | Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive credentials |
| `String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";` | SQL Injection vulnerability | Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection |
| `BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename));` | Resource not closed | Use try-with-resources statement to ensure resources are closed properly |
| `catch(IOException e) { // Silently ignore errors }` | Bad error handling | Log or handle exceptions properly to avoid silent failures |
| `public static int doStuff(int a, int b) { ... }` | Poorly named method, unclear purpose | Rename method to clearly indicate its purpose and add documentation |
| `System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());` | Null dereference risk | Add null check before calling `toUpperCase()` method |
| `public static String encryptPassword(String password) { return password; }` | Not actually encrypting | Implement proper encryption using a secure encryption algorithm |

Observation: | Function Name | Maintainability Issue |
| --- | --- |
| userExists | Poor code structure and organization, inconsistent naming conventions |
| readFile | Low readability, code duplication |
| doStuff | Violation of SOLID principles, low readability |
| printUpperCase | Low readability, null dereference risk |
| encryptPassword | Violation of SOLID principles, low readability |
