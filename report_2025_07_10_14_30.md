# Function Analysis\n| Function Name | Input Parameters with Types | Output Parameters with Types | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| userExists | String username | boolean | Checks if a user exists in the database |\n| readFile | String filename | String | Reads the contents of a file |\n| doStuff | int a, int b | int | Performs unclear operation on two integers |\n| printUpperCase | String s |  | Prints a string in uppercase |\n| encryptPassword | String password | String | Returns the input password (not actually encrypting) |\n\n# Risk Analysis\n| Code | Explanation | Proposed Modification |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `private static String DB_PASS = "password";` | Hardcoded password is a security issue | Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager to store sensitive credentials |\n| `String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";` | SQL Injection vulnerability | Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection |\n| `BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename));` | No resource close, bad error handling | Use try-with-resources statement to ensure resources are closed, and handle errors properly |\n| `if(a > 100) return b / (a - 100);` | Possible divide by zero | Add a check to prevent division by zero, or use a safe division method |\n| `System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());` | Null dereference risk | Add a null check before calling `toUpperCase()` method |\n| `return password;` | Not actually encrypting | Implement proper encryption using a secure encryption algorithm and key management |\n\n# Maintainability Analysis\n| Function Name | Maintainability Issues |\n| --- | --- |\n| userExists | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Violation of SOLID principles |\n| readFile | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Code Duplication |\n| doStuff | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Violation of SOLID principles |\n| printUpperCase | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Null dereference risk |\n| encryptPassword | Poor code structure and organization, Inconsistent naming conventions, Low readability, Violation of SOLID principles, Code Duplication |\n
